## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Clouds?


**Cloud computing** ... is a model for enabling ubiquitous, **on-demand** access to a **shared pool** of configurable **computing resources** ... which can be **rapidly provisioned and released** with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage ... may be located far from the user â€“ ranging in distance from **across a city to across the world.** - Wikipedia, Cloud Computing.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Available Clouds
.large[
* Amazon Web Services
  * Pay-per-time/machine etc.
  * Pretty cheap
  * Large range of instance configurations
  * Education grants
* Open Stack
  * Open source community project
  * Nectar in Australia, JetStream in USA, CLIMB in UK, lots of others
  * Some free for researchers (Nectar, CLIMB), some with project grants (Jetstream)

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Why Clouds?
.large[
* Elastic compute!
  * Can dynamically resource analyses
* No need to maintain the hardware
  * Provider takes on cost of hardware and maintenance
  * Cost is shared between all users
* Move the compute to the data
  * Data on East Coast?
  * Start compute there. Save on data transfer.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png) Galaxy on the Cloud
.large[
* There are cloud images (VM blueprints) available
  * with Galaxy pre-installed
  * with different sets of tools installed
  * with access to reference data
  * for different clouds. (AWS globally, JetStream, Nectar, CLIMB etc.)
* You just need credentials for the cloud you want to "launch" on.
  * Credentials are generally two strings,
  * An access key and a secret key
  * They are obtained from the cloud account admin page you want to use.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Cloud Launch
.large[
* Cloud launch is a system for launching Galaxy on cloud resources
  * Web interface located at launch.usegalaxy.org
  * Fill in the credential details, choose a location and machine size
  * Press go!
* The cloud will now provision you a computer in the cloud with Galaxy installed and ready to go.
  * Depending on your choices and availability you will also have access to reference data and various tools
  * It should only take 2-3 minutes for everything to be set up.

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Launch Demo
.large[
* Launch a Galaxy on the Cloud in NeCTAR.
  * Similar process to AWS (but free for me)
  * `launch.genome.edu.au`
  * [launch.usegalaxy.org](launch.usegalaxy.org)
* Walk through what is happening.
* Beta Launch (Cloud Launch 2.0)
  * [beta.launch.usegalaxy.org](beta.launch.usegalaxy.org)

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png) Cloud Manager

.center[![cloudman](images/cloudman_logo.png)]

.large[
* Cloud manager - Some middle ware to control cloud clusters.
* Can be used to control services such as Galaxy!
* Can mount filesystems, add/remove worker nodes, start/stop services

## ![GATC Logo](../shared-images/AdminTraining2016-100.png)  Cluster on the Cloud?
.large[
* Your cloud instance is a single machine
* CloudMan can start "worker" nodes.
  * More cloud instances (of any size)
  * Automatically connects to file system
  * Are registered in slurm setup
  * A node will take ~2-3 minutes to start and configure.

* Can set up dynamic scaling
  * Upper and lower node numbers
  * When queue is full and jobs wait certain time, new nodes are launched.
